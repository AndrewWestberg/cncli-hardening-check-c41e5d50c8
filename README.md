# CNCLI

A community-based ```cardano-node``` CLI tool. It's a collection of utilities to enhance and extend beyond those available with the ```cardano-cli```.

![Build Status](https://github.com/cardano-community/cncli/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop)

## Installation

To install CNCLI using release binaries or compile the Rust code, or update to a newer version, refer to the [installation guide](INSTALL.md). It covers staged checksum/attestation verification and least-authority `systemd` services for sync, sendtip and the leaderlog timer.

## Usage & Examples

For a list of CNCLI commands and related usage examples, please refer to the [usage guide](USAGE.md).

Results are written to stdout; tracing logs go to stderr. Operational/validation failures return exit 1 and one JSON error (unless stdout itself failed). Found orphaned blocks remain successful validation results. Shell integrations must check the exit status, not search output for `"error"`; successful sendslots has no success envelope.

Ping's timeout bounds DNS, connection and handshake together. `sync --no-service` succeeds only after reaching/committing the tip and returns its first failure. Sendtip is best-effort latest-tip reporting: newer pending tips replace older ones, rollback/disconnect invalidates stale tips, and HTTP failures wait for the next header rather than replaying a backlog.

Use SQLite for concurrent sync and leaderlog. Redb remains supported for serialized/offline operations; it is not a shared live writer. See [deployment guidance](INSTALL.md#automation).

### Contributing

Before submitting a pull request ensure that all tests pass, code is correctly formatted and linted, and that no common mistakes have been made, by running the following commands:

```bash
cargo check
```

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

```bash
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

```bash
cargo test
```

### Assistant tooling (omp)

Running omp from this repository loads Software Observatory via `.omp/mcp.json`.
It queries a bundled software-correctness catalog; it does not instrument CNCLI
or inspect Cardano databases. Node.js (compatible with the latest release),
npm/npx, and npm-registry access are required. Each launch checks npm's `latest`
release; `/mcp reload` restarts it and checks for updates.
Use `/mcp list` and `/mcp test softwareobservatory` to check the connection.
